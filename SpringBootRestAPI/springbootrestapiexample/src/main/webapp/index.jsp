       <p>
           The life Dr. APJ Kalam has been an inspiration not only for Indians, 
	   	but for people from all other countries as well. He was an epitome of many virtues, 
		dedication, self-mastery, and scientific attitude. People are born; 
		people die. But some people after they are gone leave behind them a trail of light that illumines the path for the striving followers. 
		Longfellow has praised such people as him in his poem, 
		'A Psalm of Life'. He glorifies such great souls in the following words:


		" And, departing, leave behind us

Footprints on the sands of time;

           Dr. Kalam also belongs to the class of unforgettable personalities who have left an eternal blaze-trail after their passing away. 
		Dr. Kalam can be termed as a gem of a great leader. His entire life has been an inspiration. 
		Born in a humble family, he worked his way to great success. He dedicated his life to his motherland. 
		His contributions to make India a strong nation are beyond praise. As a scientist, he gave India the power of missiles.
		Lethal Agni, Prithvi, Akash, and Nag missiles were added to the national arsenal under his able guidance.

             He was a great human being, committed leader, and unparalleled statesman. 
		He wrote many inspirational books; he was a charismatic speaker.
