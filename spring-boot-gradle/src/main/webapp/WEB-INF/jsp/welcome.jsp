<article><p>After the string of recent successes, India's missile programme guided by APJ Abdul Kalam gains in maturity and stature apart from adding a new dimension to the nation's defence capability.

In the '60s their impact was known by the acronym: MAD or Mutually Assured Destruction. Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMS) having nuclear warheads were the biggest deterrent against a military confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union.

Since then guided missiles fitted with conventional explosives have also become tremendous force multipliers for nations during a battle. With their extensive range they can push a war deep into a country's territory, imperilling even the lives of civilian populations as the Iraqi Scuds did during the Gulf War.

Dreams float on an impatient wind A wind that wants to create a new order. An order of strength and thundering of fire.
Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, My Journey, March 1994
In military terms, missiles pack more bang for the buck. They can inflict massive damage at a much lesser cost than conventional weapons.

As an opponent, surface-to-air missiles or SAMs pose a greater danger to strike aircraft than either anti-aircraft guns or jet fighters. On the battlefield, anti-tank missiles with their accuracy and reach give the army a highly lethal option.

Since they require advance rocket propulsion and guidance technology, only a handful of countries such as the US, Russia, China, France and Britain had the capability for making them. And they kept the technology a closely guarded secret. So far India had been dependent mainly on the erstwhile Soviet Union for supply of either SAMs or anti-tank missiles.

Not any longer. Recently, a series of developments have powered the nation into the rarefied strata of strategic missile competence. Topping the list is the successful third launch of Agni , India's Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM), on February 19.
With it, the country now has the capability of delivering one-tonne warheads - even nuclear ones if it so desires - to distances as far as 1,500-2,500 km with a high degree of accuracy. While it has been developed mainly to strike China, Agni's success is viewed with serious concern by the US as it conflicts with its strategic policy of halting the proliferation of nuclear missiles in the region</p></article>

Meanwhile, from June, the armed forces will start inducting over 100 Prithvis, the powerful surface-to surface missile. It is the first ever indigenously produced guided missile to become operational. With its range of 150-250 km, Prithvi makes Pakistan's entire territory vulnerable to its lethal attacks.

Also under development are a range of SAMs and a state-of-the-art anti-tank missile. Apart from adding a totally new dimension to its defence capability, the missile programme now helps India negotiate from a position of strength in international affairs.

Agni's successful launch on 19 february triggered international concern about India's nuclear intentions and escalated U.S. fears of an open-ended missile race.
In California, Timothy McCarthy, senior analyst in the programme for non-proliferation studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, views the recent developments as examples of "the maturation and diversity of India's missile capability". McCarthy, who has been closely monitoring the programme's progress, adds: "The fruits of the labour of India's controversial defence investment in the '80s are now beginning to pay off."

And the man most credited with motivating the team of defence scientists and harnessing India's diverse industrial and academic capabilities into building such frontline missiles is Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam , 62, head of India's Rs 1,000-crore defence research programme.

With awesome foresight, planning and some unconventional organisational skills, Kalam transformed moribund defence research establishments into institutes of high performance and quality that function with missionary zeal.

With his spartan lifestyle and total dedication to the programme, Kalam continues to inspire his team. Even today he occupies only two small rooms in an official guest-house in New Delhi refusing the large government quarters he is entitled to as secretary to a Union Ministry. His rooms are littered with books ranging from pulp fiction to Chinese philosophy. A veena, which he has just begun learning to play, lies covered in a corner.

And a school notebook, in which he pens poems in Tamil almost every night, sits on top of a plain wooden desk. The frail Kalam usually works till 11 in the night, reviewing various projects and only then settles down to his three loves: reading, listening to music and writing poetry. Not necessarily in that order.
Last week, clad in a white dhoti and a half-sleeved printed shirt, Kalam decided he would opt for music first. As the soothing notes of Ustad Bismillah Khan's shehnai fill the room, Kalam sways his head in enjoyment and strands of his silver-grey hair keep beat on his forehead.

He sees nothing disharmonic about discussing weapons of mass destruction against the backdrop of such serene music. Instead, with fierce conviction, he says: "Today, India can be rated as a missile power that can deliver a range of missiles any time, anywhere in the region."

Six months ago, his detractors would have laughed it off as another "Kalamitous" pronouncement. But Agni's third launch recently was proof that scientists had overcome the major technological problems that were bedevilling the programme.

On its second flight in 1991, Agni had experienced severe control and structural disturbances that terminated its flight prematurely. After extensive ground testing, project scientists overcame the problem by reconfiguring the location of its control sensors.

Kalam, however, believes his missile mission is almost over. He is restless and wants to pull out of the programme and be an academician. He is tipped to take over as vice-chancellor of Madras University. But there is mounting pressure for him to stay and plan the next generation of missiles. Or help build a hyperplane.
He humbly argues that there are far more competent people heading the various missile projects. As a line in one of his poems that he jotted down in his notebook last week states: Friends, you now have the fire to torch the Agni.</p></article>
